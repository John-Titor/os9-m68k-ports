  ✔ work out how to get all of the files onto the disk @done (22-08-22 20:28)
    ✔ build toolshed https://sourceforge.net/p/toolshed/wiki/Home/ and stash binaries in the repo @done (22-08-22 20:28)
  ✔ work out what files to put on the disk and where @done (22-08-22 20:28)
    /CMDS          - exec / trap modules (default execution path)
        cmd...
        lib ...
        -> pkg_cmd... - symlink to modules in /PKG
    /SYS           - scripts, data files
        Startup    - startup script

  ☐ package manager
  ☐ build / install 3p packages
    ☐ keep binaries in repo? or build from source? 
    ☐ keep source archives in repo? or fetch from OS-9 archive? or another repo?
    ☐ symlink into /CMDS homebrew-style?

    /PKG           - non-base-system packages
        /A.pkg     - contents of package A
        ...

  ☐ Ported apps & examples
    ✔ build infra for "simple" apps @done (22-08-10 22:01)
    ☐ hello world in assembly
    ✔ hello world in C @done (22-08-10 22:01)
    Wishlist:
  ☐ infrastructure
    ☐ termios clone?
    ☐ ncurses?
  ☐ interpreters
    ✔ bwbasic @done (22-08-22 20:28)
      ✔ valid \r vs \n handling @done (22-08-22 20:28)
        OSK says both are 0x0d, so no way to detect pure nl?
      ✔ makdir mode / permissions @done (22-08-22 20:28)
    ☐ picoc
  ☐ editors
  ☐ C++
    Use Rogue Wave STL bits from free Borland C++ 5.5 distribution?
    Only a year or so newer than the bits in the SDK, and probably not so broken. Look for (tab) comments in
    the existing headers to locate the (many) changes made for OS9.
    bitsavers.org has earlier version(s) that might be a closer match

  Installer: @low
    An image that could be dropped onto any CF card regardless of size without needing host tools to lay out a card.
    ☐ bootable installCF that has install payload in a data module (boot with cfboot)
    ☐ 'install' script that partitions / formats a CF and installs a filesystem

    mkdatamod can be used to wrap / unwrap a tarball (calls fixmod so include that)
    save can be used to extract a loaded module
    -> create tarball on desktop, convert to data module
    -> append to bootfile & generate installCF ('os9 gen')
    -> flash cfboot
    -> boot from installCF
    -> user partitions / formats CF (or do it automatically?)
    -> save data module, un-mkdatamod it into tarball, unpack tarball
    -> os9gen suitable bootfile
    -> profit!

SDK:
  ☐ go through the OS-9 archive & sort out useful things
    Surprisingly not a lot here. Sources might be useful for porting hints.
    ☐ compiler
    ☐ languages
    ☐ commands / utilities

Docs:
  ✔ document installation flow @done (22-08-22 20:28)
    ☐ references to other docs
