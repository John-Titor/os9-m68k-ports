Disk driver:
  ☐ VirtIO disk driver
    ☐ basic functionality
    ☐ support multi-sector read/write operations @medium
  ☐ booter VirtIO disk driver
  ☐ boot-from-VirtIO support in ROM
  ☐ descriptor for formatting (same unit number, different perms)

Realtime Clock:
  ☐ How do we do this? Nanoseconds from some recent epoch?

ROMS:
  ☐ 'dev' ROM with bootfile and ROMBUG
  ☐ 'diskboot' ROM aimed at disk boot, with tools for creating / fixing / installing disks

BUGS:
  ☐ Unexplained crash in the kernel with 4A84670A in a4, looks like something has smashed the stack and the value was popped and then re-used.
    Seems to happen regardless of which other modules are loaded. Not clear where the value is coming from - it appears in a few different places scattered around.
    The value seems fairly stable, as does the place it's hitting, so the bug does not appear to be layout-sensitive. Happens sometime after the first tick interrupt.

Investigations:
  ☐ qemu `-action` options for better shutdown/panic/etc behaviour
