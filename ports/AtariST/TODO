Drivers:
  ☐ existing stfd / sthd drivers have dependencies on XBIOS (mfpint, jdisint, low-memory variables, VBL) that need to be resolved
  ☐ sc68901 for serial port / console
    ☐ buffered output for less waiting in Write but emulated console does not pace bytes @low
  ☐ configure TimerC ticker in tm_mfp_timerc.a @high
  ☐ realtime clock, Ricoh 5c15 in rtc5c15.a @high
  ☐ sc6850 for keyboard/mouse?
  ☐ keyboard / virtual consoles
  ☐ IDE controller
    ☐ IDE interrupt shared with FDC might help on real hardware, but emulated disk is super fast @low

Booter:
  ☐ do proper memory probing
  ☐ use screen / keyboard for booter

Config:

Realtime Clock:
  ☐ Mega/Meta STe RTC differs from TT RTC, no RTC in older systems.
    - IKBD RTC cleared on cold boot, reset on warm boot

BUGS:
  ☐ Cannot support 68000 on Hatari.
    TOS version check in the ROM loader expects to see TOS version number at the bottom of ROM, which is mapped to zero, but OSK uses the initial stack pointer to find system variables. This ends badly. Any CPU with VBR needs VBR set to at least 8 to avoid this.

ROMS:
  ☐ 'diskboot' ROM aimed at disk boot, with tools for creating / fixing / installing disks

Hacks:
