Disk driver:
  ☐ RBF CompactFlash driver @high
  ☐ work out how to get all of the files onto the disk
    Maybe toolshed https://sourceforge.net/p/toolshed/wiki/Home/ or perhaps just Kermit and patience
  ☐ booter CompactFlash driver @medium
  ☐ boot-from-CF support in ROM @medium
  ☐ descriptor for formatting (same unit number, different perms?) @high

Hacks:
  ✔ look at one of the DUART inputs to decide whether to skip the debugger at boot @done (22-07-31 22:22)
  ☐ compress the ROM payload so that more stuff can fit @low
    Use LZSA2 (https://github.com/tattlemuss/lz4-m68k)
     or BMOW FC8 algorithm (https://www.bigmessowires.com/2016/05/06/fc8-faster-68k-decompression/)
     or LZ4 (https://github.com/tattlemuss/lz4-m68k)
     or XZ Embedded
     ✔ compile compressor for Windows @done (22-08-01 19:45)
  ✔ copy ROM payload to RAM to speed things up @done (22-07-31 22:04)
    is this just the 'loadrom' boot command? (yes)

Tidyup:
  ✔ clean up Makefiles @medium @done (22-08-01 23:11)
  ✔ move more commands to the ROM @done (22-08-01 19:54)
  ✔ deprecate initext @done (22-08-01 23:32)
  ☐ implement NOBUG ROM @low

Distro:
  ☐ go through the OS-9 archive & sort out useful things
    ☐ compiler
    ☐ languages
    ☐ commands / utilities
  ☐ document installation
    ☐ references to other docs
    ☐ M:\MWOS setup
