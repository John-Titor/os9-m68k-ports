Disk driver:
  ✔ RBF CompactFlash driver @high @done (22-08-08 00:22)
    ☐ support multi-sector read/write operations @medium

Realtime Clock (DS1302):
  ☐ nvram / flag bits @low
    31B of SRAM
    ☐ en/disable ROMBUG bit
    ☐ boot source bit(s)
    ☐ nvram access command/module? RBF driver?
    ☐ bootloader support? reconfig-like thing?

BUGS:
  ☐ enabling explicit write-through caching for DRAM leads to mshell (from bootfile) crashing
    weird

ROMS:
  ☐ chain-loadable miniature variant for calling from other ROMs
    needs more friendly load address
    aim to integrate with 'standard' CB030 ROM, or serial upload?

Hacks:
  ☐ compress the ROM payload so that more stuff can fit @low
    Use LZSA2 (https://github.com/tattlemuss/lz4-m68k)
     or BMOW FC8 algorithm (https://www.bigmessowires.com/2016/05/06/fc8-faster-68k-decompression/)
     or LZ4 (https://github.com/tattlemuss/lz4-m68k)
     or XZ Embedded
     ✔ compile compressor for Windows @done (22-08-01 19:45)
